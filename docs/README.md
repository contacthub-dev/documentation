# ContactHub

ContactHub is a secure, federated contact information sharing service designed
to protect your privacy. By using the ActivityPub protocol, ContactHub allows
you to host your own server and share your contact information with others in a
decentralized manner. Websites like Amazon, online shops, or any other site
requiring address information can use our OAuth integration to securely access
user contact information, automatically updating it when a user modifies their
details.

## Features
